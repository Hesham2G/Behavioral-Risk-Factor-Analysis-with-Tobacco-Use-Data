**Project Name**: **Behavioral Risk Factor Analysis with Tobacco Use Data**

**Project Description**:  
This project focuses on analyzing behavioral risk factors associated with tobacco use, based on a dataset containing information on various socio-demographic groups and their associated health risks. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling. 

The dataset includes information on confidence limits, sample sizes, education levels, age groups, and other features, which are processed and visualized using libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Several data preprocessing steps are performed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection. The analysis includes visualizing relationships between variables, such as the correlation between high confidence limits and sample sizes, as well as plotting distributions across various education levels and topics.

The project also applies a machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) to predict high confidence limits based on the available features. The model is trained and tested using an 80/20 split of the data, and the performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

**Key Features**:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and one-hot encoding categorical features.
- Exploratory data analysis using scatter plots, box plots, pie charts, bar charts, and heatmaps to visualize relationships and distributions.
- Predictive modeling with Random Forest Regressor to predict high confidence limits associated with tobacco use data.
- Evaluation of model performance using MSE and MAE to understand prediction accuracy.

This project provides valuable insights into behavioral health data, offering a foundation for deeper analysis of risk factors and their societal impacts. It can be used for policy-making, public health research, and targeted interventions for tobacco-related health risks.
